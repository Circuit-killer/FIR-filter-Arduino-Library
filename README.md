FIR filter Arduino Library
==========================

FIR filter converted to Arduino. The code is from this thread: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1279123369/3
Credits to Renï¿½ Knuvers for the initial code and to AlphaBeta for making it libraryesque.

I did the work of converting it to a working Arduino library. Tested in Arduino IDE 1.0.1.

Used in this project: http://sebastiannilsson.com/k/projekt/selfbalancing-robot/
